# irrlicht-demo
## Description
This is 3d demo scene made using 3d graphics rendering engine called Irrlicht.
I made my custom classes to make engine easier to work with.
## Idea
The main idea was to make a game engine on top of Irrlicht engine. I wanted to make it simmilar to Unity engine in terms of how you code, but at the same time make it more flexible to use and with ability to add extra features if needed.
## What do we have so far
I made a simple demo scene using classes that I created. So far I created Game class and Camera class. Game class basically makes most of the initialisations for you, hides most of the classes that you would have to work with if you would be working with pure Irrlicht and makes it easier to create basic window and scene. Camera class also make it easier for you to work with camera. I also planned to add more classes. But then I got bored and had to do other stuff.
